# Homework 2: Project Scaffolding Reflection

## How many hours did you spend working on this homework?
around 4 hours.

## What challenges/roadblocks did you face during this homework?
At the very start I faced a lot of issues with ESLint and dependency installs. Then, I needed a lot of thinking/research to figure out how to get the project set up -- starting from a blank slate feels a lot more daunting (and is something I've never done before in JavaScript -- even in my internships/projecsts). Once I got the framework set up, it was not too bad from there, just reading z documentation and avoiding silly syntax errors. Had some errors with the tsconfig.json but searched up some stuff to figure it out.


## Did you use AI/LLM tools for this assignment? If so, please provide a transcript or document your usage extensively below. If you did use AI, please explain why you decided to use AI for the task you used it for, what you learned from the AI responses, and explain any relevant unfamiliar terms and concepts that the AI responses generated.
I had a lot of debug issues with ESLint config (competing dependencies etc.) that I used AI to help debug. I couldn't entirely figure out why some of my npm installs/dependencies were failing (competing dependencies) so AI helped me fix this issue. The issue was fixed by downgrading ESLint to v9.
